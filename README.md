# GraphQL Students-Courses Server

This is the GraphQL server implementation used in Front End Masters' GraphQL workshop. It contains GraphQL queries and mutations to handle CRUD operations on a **courses** and **students** resource. MongoDB is used to persist the data and a connection to mLab is provided.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, install the dependencies, and run the server.

```bash
npm i
# for live reload
npm run dev
# for prod
npm start
```

The app will be served at `localhost:8080` and GraphiQL can be accessed at `localhost:8080/graphql`.
